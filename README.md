# CSC300_Coffee_Maker

Use this item to submit your Team's Week #4 Project Deliverable Report. Only ONE team member should submit this report. Feedback will be given to that team member as the report is graded and then the team member needs to convey the feedback to the rest of the team.

The instructor will assign up to 100 points to each team member who participated on this deliverable. It is the team leader's responsibility to let the instructor know if any team member is NOT participating.

Project Deliverable Report for Week #4 (100 points possible):

Document any additions/deletions/changes made to your Week #1, #2, and/or #3 Deliverable Reports but do not submit any of these again.
Create User Interface (UI) Prototypes (Storyboards) of the portion of your MVP that you will implement with C++. The UI can be either GUI or Command Line.
Implement a portion of your MVP using C++ and include the C++ Source Code as Screen shots (not file(s)) and screen shots of your MVP App running.
